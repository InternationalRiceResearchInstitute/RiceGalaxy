#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
#to use a directory of Mosaik indexed sequences data files. You will need
#to create these data files and then create a mosaik_index.loc file 
#similar to this one (store it in this directory) that points to 
#the directories in which those files are stored. The mosaik_index.loc 
#file has this format (longer white space is the TAB character):
#
#<unique_build_id>	<dbkey>	<display_name>	<fasta_file_path>
#
#So, for example, if you had hg18 indexed and stored in 
#/depot/data2/galaxy/mosaik/hg18/
#then the mosaik_index.loc entry would look like this:
#
#hg18	hg18	hg18 Pretty	/depot/data2/galaxy/mosaik/hg18/hg18.fa
#
#and your /depot/data2/galaxy/mosaik/hg18/ directory
#would contain the following files:
#TODO handle mosaik jump tables.
