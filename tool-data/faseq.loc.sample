#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
#to use genome fasta sequence files.  The faseq.loc file has this format 
#(white space characters are TAB characters):
#
# <GenomeBuild> <dir>
#
# In the dir, each file is fasta format and contains only one sequence. So,
#for example, if you had hg18 fasta sequences stored in /depot/data2/galaxy/faseq/hg18,
#then your faseq.loc entry would look like this:
#
#hg18	/depot/data2/galaxy/faseq/hg18
#
#and your /depot/data2/galaxy/faseq/hg18 directory would contain all of 
#your fasta sequence files (e.g.):
#
#-rw-r--r--  1 wychung galaxy 138082251 2008-04-16 11:57 chr10.fa
#-rw-r--r--  1 wychung galaxy    115564 2008-04-16 11:57 chr10_random.fa
#-rw-r--r--  1 wychung galaxy 137141451 2008-04-16 11:58 chr11.fa
#...etc...
#Your faseq.loc file should include an entry per line for each set of fasta 
#sequence files you have stored.  For example:
#
#hg18	/depot/data2/galaxy/faseq/hg18
#mm9	/depot/data2/galaxy/faseq/mm9
#Arabidopsis	/depot/data2/galaxy/faseq/Arabidopsis
#...etc...
