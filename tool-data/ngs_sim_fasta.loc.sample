#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables the NGS simulation
#tool to use some FASTA files. You will need to make sure that these FASTA files
#are in place and then create the ngs_sim.loc file similar to this one (store it
#in this directory) that points to the locations of those files. The ngs_sim.loc
#file has this format (white space characters are TAB characters):
#
#<unique_build_id>	<dbkey>	<display_name>	<file_base_path>
#
#So, for example, if you had hg18chrM.fa in 
#/data/path/hg18/seq/, 
#then the ngs_sim.loc entry would look like this:
#
#hg18chrM	hg18	hg18chrM	/data/path/hg18/seq/hg18chrM.fa
#
#Your ngs_sim.loc file should include an entry per line for each FASTA file you
#have stored.
#
#hg18chrM	hg18	hg18chrM	/data/path/hg18/seq/hg18chrM.fa
#phiX174	phiX	phiX174	/data/path/genome/phiX/seq/phiX.fa
#pUC18	pUC18	pUC18	/data/path/genome/pUC18/seq/pUC18.fa
