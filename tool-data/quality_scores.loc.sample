#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that is used by some
#regional variation tools.  The quality_scores.loc file has this format (white 
#space characters are TAB characters):
#
#<build>	<QualityScoreDirectoryPath>
#
#So, for example, if you had panTro2 qualit score files stored in 
#/depot/data2/galaxy/panTro2/quality_scores, then the quality_scores.loc entry 
#would look like this:
#
#panTro2	/depot/data2/galaxy/panTro2/quality_scores
#
#and your /depot/data2/galaxy/panTro2/quality_scores directory would 
#contain all of your quality score files (e.g.):
#
#-rw-r--r--  1 gua110 galaxy 10964768 2007-10-02 10:33 chr10.qa.bqv
#-rw-r--r--  1 gua110 galaxy  1749899 2007-10-02 10:33 chr10_random.qa.bqv
#-rw-r--r--  1 gua110 galaxy 11310721 2007-10-02 10:33 chr11.qa.bqv
#...etc...
#
#Your quality_scores.loc file should include an entry per line for each quality score 
#file you have stored.  For example:
#
#panTro2	/depot/data2/galaxy/panTro2/quality_scores
#rheMac2	/depot/data2/galaxy/rheMac2/quality_scores
#ponAbe2	/depot/data2/galaxy/ponAbe2/quality_scores
