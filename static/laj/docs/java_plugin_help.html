<h2>Installing the Java Plug-in</h2>
<br>
<p>

The Laj and Maj applets are written for Java 1.2 (a.k.a.
J2SE 1.2), and theoretically any web browser that fully supports
this (or any higher version) should work.  However, for best
compatibility we recommend that you download and install the official
<b>Java Plug-in</b> software from Sun Microsystems.
This plug-in generally works with a variety of web browsers,
including Internet Explorer, Netscape, and Mozilla.
<p>
The main overview page for the Java Plug-in product is
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">
http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/</a>, and an assortment
of download links is available at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/">
http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/</a>.
Sun also provides a simplified download facility (latest version
only), which is accessible via the "Download NOW" button at
<a href="http://java.com/">http://java.com/</a>.
For details about exactly which platforms are supported, see
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-configurations.html">
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-configurations.html</a>.
<p>
The plug-in is
usually bundled with the Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) and the
Java 2 Software Development Kit (JDK/SDK).  If you are given a choice
between these, either will do; the JRE is smaller because it
doesn't include developer tools, but both of them contain the
plug-in.  Note that even though Laj does not currently use any Java
features beyond 1.2, as of this writing it is compiled with version
1.3.1 of Sun's SDK, so running it with the corresponding version
(or higher) of the plug-in is recommended.  We have, however,
observed some drawing anomalies with the 1.4.x series on some
platforms (including "phantom repeats" in the symbol panel and
failure to draw the zoom box and crosshairs), so you may want to
stick with 1.3.x or 1.5.x.
<p>
Each download should come with installation instructions
(read them!), but here are some additional platform-specific
tips.
<p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
We recommend that you <b>delete any previously installed versions</b>
of the plug-in, JRE, JDK, and/or
SDK before you install the new one, to avoid getting them mixed.
For example, in Windows 98 you can do this by opening the Start
menu and choosing Settings - Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs,
then selecting from the list the items you want to uninstall.
After the new installation is complete, you may need to close
and restart your browser to make it recognize the new plug-in,
or even reboot your computer.
<p>
Note that versions of Sun's Java above 1.3.x will not work on
Windows 95.
<p>

<h3>Macintosh</h3>
<p>
Currently Sun does not have a Java Plug-in for Macs, but Mac OS X
ships with a sufficiently recent version of Java already included,
and further updates may be available via Apple's Software Update
mechanism (depending on your version of OS X).  We have observed
display anomalies in some versions (e.g., red circle has a black
background), but Laj et al. should still be usable.
For Mac OS Classic, Apple has a Java runtime called MRJ 2.2.5, but
unfortunately it only supports Java 1.1.8 (not Java 1.2) and thus
will not work with our applets.
<p>
For more information about Java on the Mac, see
<a href="http://www.apple.com/java/">
http://www.apple.com/java/</a> and 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">
http://developer.apple.com/java/</a>.
<p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>
Sun now provides versions of the Java Plug-in for Linux, in
either RPM or self-extracting binary format.
Be sure to read the installation notes first,
for system requirements and detailed instructions.
<p>

<h3>Solaris</h3>
<p>
Note that Solaris 8 already includes Java 1.2, though you may
want to install a newer version.  Sun provides versions of the
Java Plug-in for Solaris on both Sparc and x86 processors.
Be sure to read the installation notes first,
for system requirements and detailed instructions.  In particular,
note that you may need to apply some Solaris patches to your
system before installing Java, and possibly obtain additional
fonts.  You might also want to uninstall any previous versions of
the plug-in, JRE, JDK, and/or SDK to avoid getting them mixed.  After
the installation, you may need to close and restart your browser
to make it recognize the new plug-in.
<p>
One last bit of advice: at one point during our installation,
we were instructed to enter the command &nbsp;<tt>xhost +</tt>&nbsp;,
but this is a <b>bad idea</b> because it seriously compromises your
system security.  If this message appears, we recommend using proper
security protocols instead.
