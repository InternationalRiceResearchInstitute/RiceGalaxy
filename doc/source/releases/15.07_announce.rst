Highlights
===========================================================

**Interactive Environments**
  The interactive environments (IE) framework features several updates this release
  and Galaxy is now distributed with a new IE for RStudio implemented by Eric Rasche.

**Workflow Editor Enhancements**
  The workflow editor has been significantly revamped - it now uses newer tool form
  components and allow construction of workflows with tools explicitly producing
  output collections.

**Policies for Committers and Pull Requests**
  The process for adding committers to the project and fielding pull requests has 
  been formalized and documented in the source code. Three new committers have been
  added to the project - Björn Grüning, Nicola Soranzo, and Eric Rasche.
