Galaxy Interactive Environments
===============================

A GIE is a Docker container, launched by Galaxy, proxied by Galaxy, with some
extra sugar inside the container to allow users to interact easily with their
Galaxy histories.

How GIEs Work
-------------

A GIE is primarily composed of a Docker container, and the Galaxy visualization
component. Galaxy vizualisation plugins are rendered using Mako templates and
Mako templates in turn can run Python code. GIEs build upon visualization plugins,
adding features to allow for container management and proxying. This Python code
in the Mako templates is used to launch the Docker container within which a GIE
runs. Once this container is launched, we notify a proxy built into Galaxy which
helps coordinate a 1:1 mapping of users and their docker containers.

Here's a simple diagram recapping the above:

Deploying GIEs
--------------

Deploying GIEs is not a trivial operation. They have complex interactions with
numerous services, you'll need to be a fairly competent SysAdmin to debug all
of the possible problems that can occur during deployment. After the initial
hurdle, most find that GIEs require little to no maintenance.

An `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`__ role for installing and managing GIEs
can be found on
`Github <https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-interactive-environments>`__
and `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/6056>`__.

Setting up the Proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently the Galaxy proxy is a NodeJS+Sqlite3 proxy.

- Node has recently upgraded, and our proxy is pinned to an old version of
  sqlite3. As such you'll currently need to have an older version of Node
  available (0.10.X - 0.11.X vintage).
- We're working on solutions in this space to provide a better deployment
  mechanism here and fewer dependencies.
- Please note that if you have NodeJS installed under Ubuntu, it often
  installs to ``/usr/bin/nodejs``, whereas ``npm`` expects it to be
  ``/usr/bin/node``. You will need to create that symlink yourself.

Once Node and npm are ready to go, you'll need to install the dependencies

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd $GALAXY_ROOT/lib/galaxy/web/proxy/js
    $ npm install

Running ``node lib/main.js --help`` should produce some useful help text

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: main [options]

    Options:

    -h, --help             output usage information
    -V, --version          output the version number
    --ip <n>               Public-facing IP of the proxy
    --port <n>             Public-facing port of the proxy
    --cookie <cookiename>  Cookie proving authentication
    --sessions <file>      Routes file to monitor
    --verbose

There are two ways to handle actually running the proxy. The first is to have
Galaxy automatically launches the proxy as needed. This is the default configuration
as of 2014. Alternately, the proxy can be stated manually or via a system such as
Supervisord. Assuming that the ``$GALAXY_ROOT`` environment variable refers to the location of
the Galaxy installation, the command for launching the proxy is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ node $GALAXY_ROOT/lib/galaxy/web/proxy/js/lib/main.js --ip 0.0.0.0 \
        --port 8800 --sessions $GALAXY_ROOT/database/session_map.sqlite \
        --cookie galaxysession --verbose

And this can be configured in your supervisord config by adding:

.. code-block:: console


    [program:galaxy_nodejs_proxy]
    directory       = GALAXY_ROOT
    command         = GALAXY_ROOT/lib/galaxy/web/proxy/js/lib/main.js --sessions database/session_map.sqlite --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8800
    autostart       = true
    autorestart     = unexpected
    user            = GALAXY_USER
    startsecs       = 5
    redirect_stderr = true

where ``GALAXY_ROOT`` is the location of your Galaxy installation and ``GALAXY_USER`` is the username of the user that
Galaxy runs as.

Configuring the Proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration is all managed in ``galaxy.ini``. The default arguments used
for the proxy are:

.. code-block::  ini

    dynamic_proxy_manage=True
    dynamic_proxy_session_map=database/session_map.sqlite
    dynamic_proxy_bind_port=8800
    dynamic_proxy_bind_ip=0.0.0.0
    dynamic_proxy_debug=True

As you can see most of these variables map directly to the command line
arguments to the NodeJS script. There are a few extra parameters which will
be needed if you run Galaxy behind an upstream proxy like nginx or
Apache:

.. code-block:: ini

    dynamic_proxy_external_proxy=True
    dynamic_proxy_prefix=gie_proxy

The first option says that you have Galaxy and the Galaxy NodeJS proxy wrapped
in an upstream proxy like Apache or NGINX. This will cause Galaxy to connect
users to the same port as Galaxy is being served on (so 80/443), rather than
directing them to port 8800.

The second option is closely entertwined with the first option. When Galaxy is
accessed, it sets a cookie called ``galaxysession``. This cookie generally cannot be sent with requests
to different domains and different ports, so Galaxy and the dynamic proxy must
be accessible on the same port and protocol. In addition, the cookie is only
accessible to URLs that share the same prefix as the Galaxy URL. For example,
if you're running Galaxy under a URL like ``https://f.q.d.n/galaxy/``, the cookie
is only accessible to URLs that look like ``https://f.q.d.n/galaxy/*``. The
second (``dynamic_proxy_prefix``) option sets the URL path that's used to
differentiate requests that should go through the proxy to those that should go
to Galaxy. You will need to add special upstream proxy configuration to handle
this, and you'll need to use the same ``dynamic_proxy_prefix`` in your
``galaxy.ini`` that you use in your URL routes.

In the examples below, we assume that your Galaxy installation is available
at a URL such as ``https://f.q.d.n/galaxy``. If instead it is available at a
URL like ``https://f.q.d.n``, remove the ``/galaxy`` prefix from the examples.
For example ``/galaxy/gie_proxy`` would become ``/gie_proxy``. Remember that
``gie_proxy`` is the value you use for the ``dynamic_proxy_prefix`` option. If
you use a different value in that option you should change the examples
accordingly.

**Apache**

.. code-block:: apache

    # Project Jupyter specific. Other IEs may require their own routes.
    ProxyPass        /galaxy/gie_proxy/jupyter/ipython/api/kernels ws://localhost:8800/galaxy/gie_proxy/jupyter/ipython/api/kernels

    # Global GIE configuration
    ProxyPass        /galaxy/gie_proxy http://localhost:8800/galaxy/gie_proxy
    ProxyPassReverse /galaxy/gie_proxy http://localhost:8800/galaxy/gie_proxy

    # Normal Galaxy configuration
    ProxyPass        /galaxy http://localhost:8000/galaxy
    ProxyPassReverse /galaxy http://localhost:8000/galaxy

Please note you will need to be using apache2.4 with ``mod_proxy_wstunnel``.

**Nginx**

.. code-block:: nginx

    # Global GIE configuration
    location /galaxy/gie_proxy {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8800/galaxy/gie_proxy;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }

    # Project Jupyter specific. Other IEs may require their own routes.
    location ~ ^/galaxy/gie_proxy/jupyter/(?<nbtype>[^/]+)/api/kernels(?<rest>.*?)$ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8800/galaxy/gie_proxy/jupyter/$nbtype/api/kernels$rest;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

If you proxy static content, you may find the following rule useful for
proxying to GIE and other visualization plugin static content.

.. code-block:: nginx

    location ~ ^/plugins/(?<plug_type>.+?)/(?<vis_name>.+?)/static/(?<static_file>.*?)$ {
        alias /path/to/galaxy-dist/config/plugins/$plug_type/$vis_name/static/$static_file;
    }

Docker on Another Host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You might want to run your IEs on a host different to the one that hosts your
Galaxy webserver, since IEs on the same host as the webserver compete for
resources with that webserver and introduce some security considerations which
could be mitigated by moving containers to a separate host. This feature has
been available since 15.07 and is used in production at the University of
Freiburg and on usegalaxy.org.

First you need to configure a second host to be Docker enabled. In the
following we call this host ``gx-docker`` You need to start the Docker daemon
and bind it to a TCP port, not to a Unix socket as is the default. For example
you can start the daemon with

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker -H 0.0.0.0:4243 -d

On your client, the Galaxy webserver, you can now install a Docker client. This
can also be done on older systems like Scientific-Linux, CentOS 6, which do not
have Docker support by default. The client just talks to the Docker daemon on
host ``gx-docker``, and does not run anything itself, locally. You can test
your configuration for example by starting busybox from your client on the
Docker host with

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker -H tcp://gx-docker:4243 run -it busybox sh

So far so good! Note, however, that unless restricted by a firewall, this mode
of operation is insecure, as any client could connect and run containers on
``gx-docker``. If this is a concern at your site, follow the instructions in
the Docker documentation to `Protect the Docker daemon socket
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/>`__.

Now we need to configure Galaxy to use our new Docker host
to start the Interactive Environments. For that we need to edit the Jupyter GIE
configuration, ``jupyter.ini`` to use our custom docker host

.. code-block:: ini

    [main]

    [docker]
    command = docker -H tcp://gx-docker:4243 {docker_args}
    docker_hostname = gx-docker

Please adapt your ``command`` as needed.

The Jupyter GIE supports getting and fetching Galaxy history datasets entirely
through the Galaxy API so it is not necessary to share a filesystem with
``gx-docker``. However, other GIE plugins may still require this.

For those GIE plugins, we need to configure a share mount point between the
Docker host and Galaxy. Unfortunately, this can not be a NFS mount. Docker does
not like NFS yet. You could for example use a sshfs mount with the following
script

.. code-block:: bash

    if mount | grep ^gx-docker:/var/tmp/gx-docker; then
        echo "/var/tmp/gx-docker already mounted."
    else
        sshfs gx-docker:/var/tmp/gx-docker /var/tmp/gx-docker
        echo 'Mounting ...'
    fi

This will let Galaxy and the Docker host share temporary files.

Docker Engine Swarm Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Docker Engine version 1.12, Docker Engine can be configured to provide a
cluster of Docker Engines in a configuration known as *Docker Engine swarm
mode*.  This replaces the previous and similarly named *Docker Swarm*
clustering solution, which is not compatible with swarm mode.

`The Docker Engine swarm mode documentation
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/>`__ fully explains the differences, but
the major difference is that whereas under Docker Swarm one could run commands
on the swarm with ``docker run``, Docker Engine swarm mode requires one to
create persistent services with ``docker service create`` and to remove those
services once no longer in use with ``docker service rm``.

Galaxy supports both Docker Engine swarm mode and the legacy Docker Swarm
system. Legacy Docker Swarm is supported without any special configuration,
because the containers are still run with ``docker run`` as before. To support
Docker Engine swarm mode, additional configuration is required. Begin by
editing your GIE plugin's ini configuration file (e.g. ``jupyter.ini``) and set
the ``docker_connect_port`` and ``swarm_mode options`` in addition to any other
relevant options. Unless you are using a non-standard Docker image, the correct
value for ``docker_connect_port`` should be suggested to you in the sample
configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [docker]
    docker_connect_port = 8888
    swarm_mode = True

You can also enable swarm mode for *all* GIE plugins by setting
``interactive_environment_swarm_mode`` in ``galaxy.ini`` to ``True``. If using
this setting, you must still set ``docker_connect_port`` in each GIE plugin's
ini configuration file. The ``swarm_mode`` setting in individual GIE plugin
config files will override the value set in ``galaxy.ini``.

Note that your Galaxy server does not need to be a member of the swarm itself.
It can use the method outlined above in the `Docker on Another Host`_ section
to connect as a client to a Docker daemon acting as a swarm mode manager.

Once configured, you should see that your GIE containers are started and run as
services, which you can inspect using the ``docker service ls`` command and
other ``docker service`` subcommands.

**Galaxy swarm manager**

Galaxy will start a "swarm manager" process when the first swarm mode GIE is
launched. You can control this daemon with the config file
``config/swarm_mode_manager.yml``. Consult the sample configuration at
``config/swarm_mode_manager.yml.sample`` for syntax. It will automatically shut
down when no services or nodes remain to be managed.
