      filter-with:
        type: str
        default: proxy-prefix
        desc: |
          If running behind a proxy server and Galaxy is served from a subdirectory,
          enable the proxy-prefix filter and set the prefix in the
          [filter:proxy-prefix] section above.
      
      cookie_path:
        type: str
        desc: |
          If proxy-prefix is enabled and you're running more than one Galaxy instance
          behind one hostname, you will want to set this to the same path as the prefix
          in the filter above.  This value becomes the "path" attribute set in the
          cookie so the cookies from each instance will not clobber each other.

          Database connection
          Galaxy reports are intended for production Galaxy instances, so sqlite (and the default value
          below) is not supported. An SQLAlchemy connection string should be used specify an external
          database.
