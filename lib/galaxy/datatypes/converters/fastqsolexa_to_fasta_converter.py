"""
convert fastqsolexa file to separated sequence and quality files.

assume each sequence and quality score are contained in one line
the order should be:
1st line: @title_of_seq
2nd line: nucleotides
3rd line: +title_of_qualityscore (might be skipped)
4th line: quality scores
(in three forms: a. digits, b. ASCII codes, the first char as the coding base, c. ASCII codes without the first char.)

Usage:
%python fastqsolexa_to_fasta_converter.py <your_fastqsolexa_filename> <output_seq_filename> <output_score_filename>
