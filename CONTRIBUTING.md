# Contributing

Galaxy welcomes new development!
This document briefly describes how to contribute to the [core
galaxy project](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) -
also checkout our 2013 Galaxy Community
Conference presentation on the topic
([video](https://vimeo.com/channels/581875/73486255),
[presentation](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/documents/presentations/gcc2013/BakerContribute.pdf)). For
information on contributing more broadly to the Galaxy ecosystem and a
deeper discussion of some of these points - please see the
[Develop](https://galaxyproject.org/develop) section of the
[Galaxy Community Hub](https://galaxyproject.org).

## Before you Begin

If you have an idea for a feature to add or an approach for a bugfix,
it is best to communicate with Galaxy developers early. The most
common venues for this are
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues).
Browse through existing GitHub issues and Trello cards and if one seems related,
comment on it. We also maintain a [tag](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afriendliness%2Ffriendly) on Github for
smaller issues we believe would make the best entry points for new
developers.
Galaxy developers are generally available via
[IRC](https://galaxyproject.org/get-involved), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby)
and on the [development mailing list](http://dev.list.galaxyproject.org).

## Reporting a new issue

If no existing Galaxy issue/Trello card seems appropriate, a new issue can be
opened using [this form](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/new).

## How to Contribute

* All changes to the [core galaxy project](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy)
  should be made through pull requests to this repository (with just two
  exceptions outlined below).

* If you are new to Git, the [Try Git](http://try.github.com/) tutorial is a good places to start.
  More learning resources are listed at https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/ .

* Make sure you have a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

* Fork the [galaxy repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) on
  GitHub to make your changes.
  (While many Galaxy instances track
  [galaxy-dist](https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist), active development
  happens in the galaxy GitHub repository and this is where pull requests
  should be made).
  To keep your copy up to date with respect to the main repository, you need to
  frequently [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/):
  ```
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git checkout dev
    $ git merge upstream/dev
  ```

* Choose the correct branch to develop your changes against.

  * Additions of new features to the code base should be pushed to the `dev` branch (`git
    checkout dev`).

  * Most bug fixes to previously release components (things in galaxy-dist)
    should be made against the recent `release_XX.XX` branch (`git checkout release_XX.XX`).

  * Serious security problems should not be fixed via pull request - please
    see [the Galaxy security policies](SECURITY_POLICY.md) for information
    about responsibly disclosing security issues.

* If your changes modify code - please ensure the resulting files
  conform to Galaxy [style
  guidelines](https://galaxyproject.org/develop/best-practices).

* Galaxy contains hundreds of tests of different types and complexity
  and running each is difficult and probably not reasonable at this
  time (someday we will provide a holistic test procedure to make this
  possible). For now, please just review the [running tests
  documentation](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/running-tests)
  and run any that seem relevant. Developers reviewing your pull
  request will be happy to help guide you to running the most relevant
  tests as part of the pull request review process and may request the
  output of these tests. You can run the continuous integration tests locally
  using `tox`, example: `tox -e py27-lint,py27-unit`.

* Commit and push your changes to your
  [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).

* Open a [pull
  request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
  with these changes. You pull request message ideally should include:

   * A description of why the changes should be made.

   * A description of the implementation of the changes.

   * A description of how to test the changes.

* The pull request should pass all the continuous integration tests which are
  automatically run by GitHub using e.g. Travis CI.

* Your pull request will be handled according to
  [some rules](doc/source/project/organization.rst#handling-pull-requests).

## A Quick Note about Tools

  For the most part, Galaxy tools should be published to the
  [Tool Shed](https://galaxyproject.org/toolshed) and not in this
  repository directly. If you are looking for migrated
  core tools that used to exist in this repository - please checkout
  the [tools-iuc](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)
  repository on GitHub.

  More information about tool development can be found [on the comunity hub](https://galaxyproject.org/develop).
