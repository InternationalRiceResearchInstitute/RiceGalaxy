edu.psu.galaxy.GalaxyServer.plist:

    This is the LaunchDaemon definition for OS X (pre-Snow Leopard?). Assuming
    that Galaxy is installed in the home directory of the user 'galaxy', run:
        mkdir /Users/galaxy/galaxy_dist/log
        sudo cp /Users/galaxy/galaxy_dist/contrib/edu.psu.galaxy.GalaxyServer.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
        sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/edu.psu.galaxy.GalaxyServer.plist
    Launch Galaxy with:
        sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/edu.psu.galaxy.GalaxyServer.plist
    Galaxy will now be started everytime the computer starts.
