        <readme>ATLAS_LIB_DIR and ATLAS_INCLUDE_DIR (including libatlas.a) will be exported for later use.
        During ATLAS library compilation, ATLAS performs code efficiency checks. These checks can only provide optimal results, if "frequency scaling" is disabled on the CPU, and no other load-intense processes are running. 
        Ideally, you should compile on an empty cluster node with CPU frequency scaling disabled (see "cpufreq-selector" or "cpufreq-set").
